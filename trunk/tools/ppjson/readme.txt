This is a pretty printer and validator for json. It's based on the fcl-json package.

This tool is used to make sure the physical properties component models are valid JSON 
files and uniformly formatted when released.

The plan is to use this tool for creating the releases. Ideally it will work via the 
build system to be invoked on installing the project files.

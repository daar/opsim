Coding Standards
================

Following are the references to be used when coding for this project. These rules are historical "de facto" standards used by the Borland and communities like Freepascal (recent parts of code) and Lazarus. This is the motivation for adhering to them: they promote more readable, reliable and organized code. The ultimate benefit is that you will write code less suitable to flaws. Since this information is copyrighted and freely available on the Internet, rather than reproducing it here, I am going to provide the bookmarks below.

The complete guide
------------------
This reference is the "Object Pascal Style Guide - byCharles Calvert". It is quite more comprehensive and details. It has very useful comments reasoning how the things are done that very way. If you are no only interested on *how* but also *why* to do the things that way, this doc is for you:

or

Day to day use
--------------
The second recommendation I do is the "Delphi 4 Developer's Guide Coding Standards Document". Its conciseness turn it a very good source for quick reference. The whole document is in just one html page, allowing easy search for key words. You can find this doc through the link:

A good article on how to comment code is:

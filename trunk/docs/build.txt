Quick start instructions for building OpSim the open source Chemical Engineering Process 
Simulator.

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION:
The following is a basic outline for compiling and installing OpSim...

  - To build you'll first need to setup a build environment. The procedure for this
    can vary greatly depending on your OS so I'll only cover the high points...
  - You'll need the latest version of the Free Pascal Compiler (FPC 3.0.0).
  - Once you have a working build environment you can build OpSim by running the configure 
    application. You can either compile and run it, or use instantFPC which will do both 
    at the same time e.g.

       instantfpc configure.pp

  - Configure will test your environment, compile fpmake and cleanup the folder from 
    compiled units
  - You can now build OpSim by issuing : ./fpmake install
  - If all goes well you should see the folders ./build/build.<plat> where <plat>
  is the name of your platform. Contained in the build folder should be the file
  ribify.<ext> where <ext> is the file extension of the Python modules for your
  platform (such as ".so" or ".pyd").OpSim will be compiled and installed

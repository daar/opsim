Quick start instructions for building OpSim: the open source process 
simulator.

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION:

The following is a basic outline for compiling and installing OpSim...

  - To build you'll first need to setup a build environment. The procedure for this
    can vary depending on your OS so I'll only cover the high points...
  - You'll need the latest version of the Free Pascal Compiler (FPC 3.0.0).
  - Once you have a working build environment you can setup the build environment by 
    running fmake.
  - You can now build OpSim by issuing ./make
  - To install the application, including all platform dependent libraries, scripts
    and other supporting files issue a ./make install.
  - If all goes well OpSim will be compiled and installed on your machine.
